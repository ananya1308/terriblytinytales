- This repository contains an assignment from TerriblyTinyTales. The assignment focuses on building a mobile-friendly "profile screen" with the following features:
- # Features
  1).Renders a clean and elegant profile screen suitable for mobile devices, as follows: [Profile](https://www.terriblytinytales.com/profile.jpeg) (this is a sample screenshot taken from mobile view)

  2).The profile data is hardcoded into this ![data.json](./src/assets/image.png) file and then fetched into Stories component.

  3).The screen when opened on different mobile types, is rendered consistently. This can be checked by changing device types in chrome's developer tools.
