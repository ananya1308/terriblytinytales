This repository contains an assignment from TerriblyTinyTales. The assignment focuses on building a mobile-friendly "profile screen" with the following features:

## Features

1. **Profile Screen:**
   - Renders a clean and elegant profile screen suitable for mobile devices.

2. **Data Handling:**
   - Profile data is hardcoded in `data.json`.
   - The `Stories` component fetches and displays this data dynamically.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - The screen when opened on different mobile types, is rendered consistently. This can be checked by changing device types in chrome's developer tools.

## Getting Started

1. I have made three components Stories, Navbar and Card in the same order.

2. I have hosted this site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and All details is here on the github readme.

3. Libraries used : 'Tailwind CSS' , 'React-Icons'

4. To run this code on your system , Clone this repository and cd into the project directory and run the command npm install and then npm run dev and you're good to go.

5. Thankyou , looking forward to your reply.
